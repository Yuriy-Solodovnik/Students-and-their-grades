# Students and their grades
The aim of the study is to explore the possibilities provided by the LINQ to data mechanism when retrieving data from related collections.   
The application stores information about subjects, students and their grades. Through dialog boxes you can edit lists of students (add, delete, change last name) and subjects (add, change name, delete), add grades, sort list by student last name or subject name, filter (select query results) from individual subject.
